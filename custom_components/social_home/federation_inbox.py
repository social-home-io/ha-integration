"""Public federation inbox endpoint.

Spec §7.10. Other Social Home instances can't reach the add-on
container directly — it sits behind the Supervisor's private
network. The integration therefore exposes a public URL on the
Home Assistant HTTP server, and when a peer POSTs a federation
envelope to it we proxy the raw bytes to the add-on's internal
``/federation/inbox/{inbox_id}`` and mirror the response back.

The endpoint also doubles as the WebRTC fallback transport: when
DataChannel pairing fails (strict NAT, missing TURN, etc.) bulk
content — including chunked photos / files — flows through here
instead. Size policy therefore lives in the add-on (which knows
the per-event caps and chunking rules) — the integration is a
pure passthrough.

This module does not decrypt, validate, or even JSON-parse the
envelope: the add-on runs the full §24.11 validation pipeline, so
any crypto in the integration would only add latency + risk. The
Ed25519 signature sitting inside the envelope body is the auth —
that's why ``requires_auth = False`` on the view.
